# Full-Stack Invoice Management Application

# ðŸš€ Overview

This is a full-stack invoice management application currently under active development with ongoing feature updates. I built both the frontend and backend to strengthen my skills in MERN stack development and gain hands-on experience in building scalable applications.

2. Backend:
     -  Node.js

     -  MongoDB

     -  Mongoose
